        <h3>Age Policy</h3>
        <p>Careful consideration is used to determine age levels for all camps. To provide the highest quality experience for all students, it is necessary to adhere to the specified age ranges. If it is revealed that a responsible party manipulated a childâ€™s date of birth in order to get them into a camp that is not age-appropriate, the child will be cancelled out of the camp and the responsible party will held responsible for all cancellation fees.</p>
